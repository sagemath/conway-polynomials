conway-polynomials-0.6 (2023-11-23)

  * Happy Thanksgiving.

  * This is the first standalone python version of the package.

  * The source repository and issue tracker are now public.

  * The data are no longer pre-processed; we now read the coefficients
    directly from the upstream file. This is more transparent (easier
    to verify) and much easier to update if the source data ever
    changes.
